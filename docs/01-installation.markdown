Installation
============

Red Tape requires Leiningen 2.  Add the following to your `project.clj`:

    [red-tape "1.0.0"]

That's all there is to it.  Red Tape depends on one other library (Slingshot)
but Leiningen should handle that for you.

Once you've got it installed, move on to the [basics guide](../basics/).
